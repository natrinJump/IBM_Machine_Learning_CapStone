## Background
Machine Learning has emerged as a transformative force in the realm of data-driven technologies, empowering systems to learn patterns and insights from data without explicit programming. At its core, ML allows computers to make data-driven decisions, improving performance over time based on the information it processes. One captivating application of machine learning is the development of Recommender Systems. These systems utilize algorithms to analyze user behavior, preferences, and historical interactions to predict and recommend items or content tailored to individual tastes. Consider popular platforms like Netflix, where ML-driven Recommender Systems suggest movies or series based on viewing history, or e-commerce giants like Amazon, which leverage similar systems to propose products suited to a user's preferences. The versatility and impact of Recommender Systems showcase the potential of machine learning to enhance user experiences across diverse domains.
